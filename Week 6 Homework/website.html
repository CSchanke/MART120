<h1>Welcome to my website about camels.</h1>
<br>
Camels are not my favorite animal, but they do feature in my favorite gif of all time.
Even though they aren't my favorite, I still find camels interesting.
Here's why:
<ul>
<li>They look goofy.</li>
<li>They make funny noises.</li>
<li>They are extremely stubborn and also very stupid, which is an awesome combination.</li>
</ul>

<sub>Get it? Because camels have humps on their backs?</sub>
