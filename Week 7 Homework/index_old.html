<h1 style="color:red">Welcome to my website about camels.</h1>
<br>
Camels are not my favorite animal, but they do feature in my favorite gif of all time.
Even though they aren't my favorite, I still find camels interesting.
Here's why:
<ul>
<li><span>They look goofy.</span></li>
<li><span>They make funny noises.</span></li>
<li><span>They are extremely stubborn and also very stupid, which is an awesome combination.</span></li>
</ul>
