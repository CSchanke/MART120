	Command Line Interfaces, or CLIs for short, are a method of passing commands to a computer directly with very little translation
between human speech and computer code. They often appear as a black background with white text upon the user can type various commands.
These commands vary from system to system, but always give the user more complete control over the computer. GUIs, or Graphical User 
Interfaces, do not always give the user complete and direct control over the computer's functions. Instead, they often layer commands 
under a thickveneer of graphic design in order to make the operation easier to understand and complete for the average user.
	It is considered unusual for end users to interact with the command line in a computer today, as most users will not understand
exactly how to do this. In addition, most essential functions are available through a graphical user interface in Windows and MAC
operating systems. However, in amny distributions of the Linux operating system (for desktop), the CLI, often called the terminal, is still
a primary means of operating the computer. Despite how uncommon it is for the average computer user to leverage the command line, it does
have uses today.

partitions.
