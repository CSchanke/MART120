Final Project Proposal

I have discussed at realative length with Professor McKague what I intend to do for the final project and have been working it on and off
for a few weeks now. Here is what I intend to do:
-Make a simple game. I'm not focused on visuals, only mechanics. Therefore, it will mostly consist of lines and circles.
-Create an interesting concept. I have decided upon a simple game in which the player must destroy a horde of marauding circles.
-Implement collision. This game idea will require collision. P5.js does not make that particularly easy.
-Embrace happy accidents. I have decided on a 'point of percussion' mechanic, which means that in order to damage a circle, the player
	must hit said circle with a certain 'sweet spot' on the weapon (i.e. line).
-Flesh it out. In order that the game should be entertaining and not feel unfair or broken, I intend to implement a 'weapon switching' system.
	This will allow the player to select the appropriate (or their favorite) length of line in order to slay evil circles with.
-More! The circles will have health values, and the different 'weapons' will have damage values, lending a modicum of tactical thinking
	to be required.
-MORE! THe weapons will modify player movement speed to reflect their weight and help balance them.
-Still not enough! The enemies will come in waves, with more circles spawning each time.
-Go for the encore! If I have the time (and I make no promises to that), I would like to implement a basic upgrade system, by which the player
	can choose to grow in power after each wave. Ideally, I'd have three options to choose from. Maybe one is a jump height modifier, one
	could be a new weapon unlock, or some more HP, so on and so forth.
The end.
