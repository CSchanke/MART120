Thoughts: Challenges and Overcoming Them

I'm no stranger to challenges. Growing up was isn't easy for anyone, and I'm no exception.
My father and I were inseparable until he passed away when I was eight, following which my 
mother became abusive, and the only family I had nearby were my grandparents, who took on 
the role of parents as best they could. These experiences taught me many many things, but
there are a few highlights.
One of the most important lessons I learned was that there is no such thing as a dead end.
There is a way out of every situation, and every problem has a solution. To my mind,
willpower is an infinite resource which must be paid for sacrifice. For example, if
I need a car, I could buy a junker and fix it up for lower cost than a newer one,
but it mightn't ultimately be worth it because of the time and energy investment.
However, if it's the only choice, it's going to get done.
Another lesson I learned is not to sell oneself short. My grandpa insitlled in  me from
a young age that, if I can just get my hands on something, I can fix it, build it, operate
it, whatever. I think this is true for everyone, but they don't have the right mindset
to see it through. Everyone goes through hard times, and everyone can fight through it.
Some would say I got dealt a poor hand early on in life, but I retort that everyone
experiences their own extremes, and that others having worse troubles doesn't invalidate
their own. This thinking leads to a lot of people adopting an 'I can't' mentality, which
doesn't help anyone.
