Learning Styles

There are many ways to learn something. Some people like reading or receiving verbal instruction
whilst others prefer visual aids. Then there's my group: the people who learn by doing things.
I can read a book, I can hear a lecture, and I can see a diagram, but none of it matters until
I get my hands on the problem. I think this is a much more practical way to learn things than
the other options because you gain knowledge and expeerience at the same time. growing both
fields is important to being good at things you do, and gaining both simultaneously reduces the
chances of over or under-thinking issues. For example, in medicine there is a common saying,
"When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras." This saying is meant to imply that, if
a patient complains of headache after walking into a wall, suspect a headache, not a brain tumor.
Someone who has learned medicine mostly from books and lectures might fall into that trap. On
the other hand, someone who has learned mostly by experience might not even be aware of the
possibility of a brain tumor. THat's why it is important to suppliment llearning with multiple
approaches.
