Pausch Last Lecture Reflection

One of the things Pausch said in his was, "When you've has something for 10 years that you hold
so precious it's the toughest thing in the world to hand it over, and the only advice I can give
you is to find somebody better than you to hand it over to..." (Pausch, 2007). This sentence connected 
with me on a very deep level. This is because Randy Pausch passed away in  June of 2008 from complications 
with liver cancer, which is only a few months before my own father would pass away from a brain tumor. 
My dad worked for an agriscience company for over a decade. He was the head of their IT department and 
he built their network—quite literally with his own two hands. Eight years after his passing, I would 
join the same company in the same department and undertake a full rebuild of their network across three states.
	There’s a lot to be said about the pressure put on a young boy’s shoulders to fill his father’s 
role, and it’s caused me my fair share of turbulence, but it did certainly motivate me growing up. It’s 
natural for a parent to wish for their children to be better than they were, doubly so in a family like mine 
where career fields and interests are more or less passed down from generation to generation. The reason 
Pausch’s statement resonated so well with me is because it gives me the other side of my equation. There’s 
a lot of pressure on the person chosen to succeed someone who does great things, but what I never realized 
growing up is that there is as much pressure on the person being succeeded.
	While I can’t directly relate to his position, I can, in an odd sort of way, understand it. I’ve 
seen how that kind of situation can put pressure on an individual, even if I might not have realized it at the time.
